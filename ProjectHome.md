In this project we will share up to three different channel models which represents three orthogonal ways of operation: first, a simple error model based only on the distance between the transmitter and the receiver; second, a Hidden Markov Process trained from captures obtained over a real measurements campaign, and, at last, a rather complex wireless model based on the estimation of the received link quality (SNR) through an auto-regressive filter.
